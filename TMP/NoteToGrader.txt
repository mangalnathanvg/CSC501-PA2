1) Test cases 2 and 6 will only pass when run separately.
2) Test cases 1, 3, 5 will pass when all tests are run continuously.
3) Did not implement frame replacement policies. Test 7 and Test 8 will fail
4) Had trouble with shared backing store, so could not work on that. Test 4 will fail

In total, 5 test cases should pass when each test case is run separately.
I hope you consider.
